            <p>
                AutoMerge aims to resolve merge conflicts that cannot be resolved by existing structured merge approaches.
                It is built on the top of JDime, a state-of-the-art structured merger.
                It employs the power of version space algebra and the basic rules of three-way merge.

            <p>
                Resolving conflicts is the main challenge for software merging. The existing
                merge tools usually rely on the developer to manually resolve conflicts. This
                is of course inefficient. We propose an interactive approach for resolving
                merge conflicts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for
                conflict resolution of structured merge. To represent the possibly very large
                set of candidate programs, we propose an expressive and efficient
                representation by version space algebra. We also design a simple mechanism for
                ranking resolutions in the program space, such that the top-ranked resolution
                is very likely to meet the developer's expectation. We prototype our approach
                as a merge tool AutoMerge, and evaluate it on 244 real-world conflicts arising
                from 10 open-source projects. Results show great practicality of our
                approach.
